# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE: 22/03/2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1.Find an empty cell (with value 0) on the Sudoku board.

2.Try placing numbers (1â€“9) in the empty cell.

3.For each number, check if it is valid by verifying the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid constraints.

4.If a valid number is found, recursively attempt to solve the rest of the board.

5.If the board is solvable, print the completed board; otherwise, backtrack and try another number.

6.If no valid number fits, backtrack to previous cells until a solution is found or it's determined that the puzzle is unsolvable.
