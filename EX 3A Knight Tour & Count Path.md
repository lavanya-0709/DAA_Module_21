# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE: 15/03/2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1.Start from the knightâ€™s initial position and mark it as visited.

2.Use a queue (BFS approach) to explore all valid moves from the current position.

3.For each move, check if the new position is inside the board and not yet visited.

4.If the new position is the target, return the number of moves taken to reach it.

5.Otherwise, add the new position to the queue with incremented move count.

6.Repeat until the queue is empty or the target is found.

            if isInside(nx,ny,N) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny]=True

    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
